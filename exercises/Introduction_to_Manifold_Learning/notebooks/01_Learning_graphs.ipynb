    "## What is a graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph, [in the mathematical sense](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Graph.html), is a collection of nodes and edges. Sometimes nodes are called vertices, and sometimes graphs are called networks, but it's all the same thing. The mathematical notation for a graph is usually:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{G} = (\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which simple says that a graph $\\mathcal{G}$ comprises a set of vertices (or nodes) $\\mathcal{V}$ and edges (or connections) $\\mathcal{E}$ connecting nodes. In this workshop, we're only going to consider *undirected graphs*, which treats a connection between two nodes $\\mathcal{V}_{i}$ and $\\mathcal{V}_{j}$ as  linking the two nodes in both directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our lab has developed a toolkit for analyzing graphs called [`graphtools`](https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/graphtools), and some of the backend is provided by the excellent [`pygsp`](https://github.com/epfl-lts2/pygsp) toolkit. "

We picked these packages because they provide direct interfaces for some important matrices relevant for working with graphs. The other popular package for working with graphs is `NetworkX`, but it approaches graphs from a network science perspective rather than with a graph theoretic approach.\n",
